                <h2>Why learn about fashion history?</h2>
                <p>Clothing is so much more than something to wear or look at. It has been a part of human life for centuries and plays meaningful roles in many aspects of life and society; in the past and today.</p>
                <h2>Some significant roles of clothing are:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Practical Function and Protection</li>
                    <li>Religious or Spiritual Symbolism</li>
                    <li>Cultural Rituals</li>
                    <li>Status Representation</li>
                    <li>Career Status</li>
                    <li>Self Expression</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Clothing has so many uses and meanings. From simple everyday use to big cultural statements, clothing plays important parts in peopleâ€™s lives, whether they think about it or not.</p>
