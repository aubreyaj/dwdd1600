                <h1>1900s-1910s</h1>
                <h2>1900s</h2>
                <p>The beginning of the 1900s saw a lot of technological developments from the Industrial Revolution. Things like transportation and manufacturing were becoming more sophisticated and accessible. At the same time, the delicate and romantic styles of the previous Edwardian era still had a lot of influence.</p>
                <h3>Popular Fashion Trends</h3>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Three Piece Suit</dt>
                    <dd>Men wore a collared shirt, vest, and pants with a coat; often a long straight frock coat. Top hats, canes, watch chains and tie pins were popular accessories.</dd>
                    <dt>Shirtwaist</dt>
                    <dd>Shirtwaists are dresses or two piece shirt and top sets where the top part more closely resembles men’s shirts than the traditional women’s bodice. These were often decorated with lace, embroidery and ruffles. <em>Women wore these with several layers of undergarments to create more exaggerated figures</em>.</dd>
                    <dt>S-Bend</dt>
                    <dd>The S-bend was the fashionable silhouette for women of this time and they wore corsets and undergarments to create a curved, s-like shape. The S-bend focused on having a narrow waist with the top part of the body pushed forward and the hips pushed back.</dd>
                    <dt>Modesty</dt>
                    <dd>Clothing generally covered the whole body, even in sports and leisure activities. Knickerbockers: knee-length pants, were worn by men in sporting activities, but it was still common to wear collared shirts and jackets. Women usually wore long sleeves and skirts that covered their ankles, except for evening and tea gowns where their arms were more exposed. Women’s sportswear still included long skirts.</dd>

                <h3>Influences of the Time</h3>
                <dl>
                    <dt id="ind">Industrial Revolution</dt>
                    <dd>The Industrial Revolution made resources and everyday necessities more easily obtainable. There was a growing middle class and people had extra money to spend and more time for leisure. It was popular for people to change into multiple outfits throughout the day for different occasions. Elegant gowns and suits were used for social gatherings.</dd>
                </dl>
            

                <h2>1910s</h2>
                <p>World War 1 began in 1914. While soldiers were fighting, society’s focus shifted to work and resources. <strong>Practicality</strong> was important and fashion followed suit.</p>
                <h3>Popular Fashion Trends</h3>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Work Wear</dt>
                    <dd>Uniforms and work clothes had a huge influence on fashion at this time. Both men and women wore practical and protective coats inspired by officers' uniforms and work clothes. Women wore less restrictive underclothing and dressed in simple outfits with straight silhouettes. It became more common for women to wear skirts above the ankles and some women’s uniforms included breeches instead.</dd>
                </dl>
                <h3>Influences of the Time</h3>
                <dl>
                    <dt id="warone">World War 1</dt>
                    <dd>As many of the men went to fight in the war, it was left to the women to take over the jobs they left behind. Practical clothing for work was necessary in women’s wear and this led to a shift away from more restrictive fashions and expectations. At the same time, preserving resources was important, so simple cuts of fabric with less decoration became more favorable in clothing.</dd>
